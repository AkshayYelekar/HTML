            Ramadhir singh 24 March</b> From where I'm perched in the 21st century, it is difficult to fathom that once upon a time Java titles were in scarce supply. But such was the state back in the earliest days of Java when all to be had was a modicum of treasures published by a few Sun engineers such as "Hooked on Java" by Arthur Van Hoff et.al. and "The Java Handbook" by Patrick Naughton.

Those books certainly filled a void, but coming in at just three or four hundred pages each they necessarily made quantum assumptions about what you knew about programming and in particular about object oriented programming. <br>

<b>Cornolius Fudge 03 August</b> March of 1996 brought forth "Core Java" a 600 page single-volume treatise by Cay Horstmann and Gary Cornell that made no assumptions and taught the reader Java from the ground up, in a clear and readable style reminiscent of the early programming classics by Brian Kernighan and Patrick Henry Winston.

I have released Core Java (9th Edition). This is a two-volume tome weighing in at 974 pages for Volume I (Fundamentals) and 1128 for Volume II (Advanced Features). In it you will find everything you ever wanted to know about Java 7, the latest release of the Java Development Kit (JDK), including collections, generics, concurrency, and all of the Java embellishments introduced since the first edition of the JDK.

The writing style is as clear and readable as ever, and is replete with examples that are basic but not trivial. It is evident that a great deal of thought went into creating those examples, which are sufficiently detailed to provide a meaningful reference. The book is scattered with frequent "C++ Note" annotations that are intended to guide the C++ programmer on the corresponding Java idiom.
